# PW Crack 3
AUTHOR: LT 'SYREAL' JONES
## Description
Can you crack the password to get the flag?
Download the password checker [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/17/level3.py) and you'll need the encrypted [flag](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/17/level3.flag.txt.enc) and the [hash](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/17/level3.hash.bin) in the same directory too.
There are 7 potential passwords with 1 being correct. You can find these by examining the password checker script.

hint:
```bash
# Read the python file.

# There is a list of password provided provide it one by one 
# found '87ab' is the password

python level3.py
```
